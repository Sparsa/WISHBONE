# Wishbone BUS design using TSL synthesis
* TSL or Temporal Stream logic is used to specify the properties of the bus system. Then we use the TSL toolkit to convert that TSL specification to LTL. Then using Strix (or any other syntehsis tool) we can convert the LTL to a realizable model. Then use the output to create a Control.hs. And also you have to implement the implementation of the Datapath.
* TSL is very interesting logic because, the it allows us to clearly distinguish between the Control and Data path. So, the Data paths are open to interpretation using functional abstraction. This allows us to reuse the control path for different situations where the data path are different but they share same control path.
